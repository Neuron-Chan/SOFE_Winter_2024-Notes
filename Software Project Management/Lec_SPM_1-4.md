  # Outline:
*What is software project management?* Is it really different from *ordinary* project management?

*How do you know when a project has been successful?* E.g., do the expectations of the customer/client match those of the developers?

# Why is project management important?

Large amounts of money are spent on Info & Comms. Technology (ICT).

- Projects often fail; Standish Group claim only a third of ICT projects are successful. 82% were late and 43% exceeded their budget.
- Poor project management is a major factor in these failures.

# What is a project?

The definition can vary, but its most important aspects are its *planning* and *size*.

To compare:

Jobs – repetition of very well-defined and well understood tasks with very little uncertainty
Exploration – e.g. finding a cure for cancer: the outcome is very uncertain

Projects lie in the middle between a job and exploration.

A task is more 'project-like' if it is:
- Non-routine
- Planned
- Aiming at a specific target
- Carried out for a customer
- Carried out by a temporary work group
- Involving several specialisms
- Made up of several different phases
- Constrained by time and resources
- Large and/or complex

## Exercise 1.1
Which of the following is a project, a routine, or an exploration:
<details>
  <summary>Producing an edition of a newspaper</summary>
routine
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Building the channel tunnel.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Getting Married</summary>
project</details>

<details>
  <summary>A research project into what makes a good human-computer interface.</summary>
exploration
</details>

<details>
  <summary>An investigation into the reason why a user has a problem with a computer system.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>A programming assignment for a second year computing student.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Writing an operating system for a new computer</summary>
exploration
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Installing a new version of a word processing application in an organization</summary>
routine
</details>

Invisibility, Complexity, Conformity (compliance w/ standards, rules, or laws), and Flexibility make software more problematic to build than other engineered artefacts.

Projects can be

- **In-house:** clients & employers are employed by same organization
- **Out-sourced:** clients & employers are employed by different organizations

"Project manager" could be:
- a ‘contract manager’ in the client organization
- a technical project manager in the supplier/services organization

### Activities covered by project management
Feasibility study
- Is project technically feasible and worthwhile from a business point of view?

Planning
- Only done if project is feasible

Execution
- Implement plan, but plan may be changed as we go along

### Some ways of categorizing projects
Distinguishing different types of project is important, as different types of task need different project approaches e.g.

- **Voluntary** systems (such as computer games) versus **compulsory** systems e.g. the order processing system in an organization
- **Information** systems versus **embedded** systems
- **Objective-based** versus **product-based**


## Objective vs. Product-Driven

Consider the following scenarios:
- Is implementing a new pay-roll system an objective or product-driven project?
- Implementing a new iPhone app?
- Switching a database from DB2 to Oracle?


## Embedded Systems

It includes:
- ATM software
- Car climate control
- Car airbag, ABS, and cruise control systems


# Stakeholders

The people who have a stake or interest in the project, and can include _clients_ or _developers._ These include:

- Internal project members
- Organization members unrelated to project
- Outside of organization

Different stakeholders may have different objectives; must define common project objectives.

# Setting Objectives

Answering the question: "What do we have to do to have a success?"
- Need for a **project authority**
  - Sets the project scope
  - Allocates/approves costs
- Could be one person - _**or**_ a group
  - Project Board
  - Project Management Board
  - Steering committee
 
## Objectives

Informally, the objective of a project can be defined by completing the following statement:

_"The project will be regarded as a success if..."_

Rather like _post-conditions_ for the project

Focus on **what** will be put in place, **rather than how** activities will be carried out

### S.M.A.R.T.

S – Specific: project is concrete and well-defined

M – Measurable: satisfaction of the objective can be objectively judged

A – Achievable: it is within the power of the individual or group concerned to meet the target

R – Relevant: the objective must be relevant to the true purpose of the project

T – Time-constrained: there is a defined point in time by which the objective should be achieved

### Goals/Sub-objectives

Steps along the way to reach an objective. Informally, the following statement can be used to define a goal:

"To reach objective X, the following must be in place:

Goal A,

Goal B,

Goal C, etc..."

A goal is often attributed to an individual, who may have the power to complete the goal, but not the objective itself necessarily. For example:

- _Overall objective_ – user satisfaction with software product
- _Analyst goal_ – accurate requirements
- _Developer goal_ – reliable software

# Measures of effectiveness

**How do we know that the goal or objective has been achieved?**

By a practical test, that can be objectively assessed.
e.g. for user satisfaction with software product:
- Repeat business – they buy further products from us
- Number of complaints – if low, etc.
