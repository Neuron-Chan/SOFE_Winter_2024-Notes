Missed midterms are deferred to Final exam.

Final is comprehensive

Project stuff:

- Project will look t estimating economics connected to different possible industrial applications
  - Multiple Hybrid electric energy systems
  - These are some of the alternatives that will be proposed. However the group in the proposal can put something it retains interesting forward.
 
3 PARTS
A) Initial Investigation (By Week 6)
B) COST Estimation (DATA / Week 10)
C) Final Report w/ Presentation (recorded)

Energy project will primarily look at estimating the economics connected to different electrical power plants alternatives (example:)
a) Nuclear SMR Reactor (Nuscale)
b) a PV solar power plant
c) a Wind Farm w/ Battery Storage
d) a Turbogas
e) Geothermal P.P

Each group will be composed by 5 people each of whom responsible for 1 part. [S.A.M. Software will be used](https://sam.nrel.gov/)

<ins>Costs will have to include:</ins>

a) Installation

b) operations & maintenance

c) Fuel

d) Personnel

e) Land

f) Final disposal

Each group will be expected to conduct proper literature review. A proposal of Hybrid A vs Hybrid B is expected (later on *compared for Economics* Considerations). A final Presentation w/ pre-recorded video will be uploaded as part of the deliverables.

All work & conclusions presented / written in reports / quizzes must be fully justified and explained.

All exams are closed books, closed notes, unless stated differently. Exams might be on Canvas or on Paper. All quizzes are considered pop quizzes unless previously announced / or stated.

Always have

a) your Calculator
b) Eng. Economics Formula Sheet

Assignments, Mini Quizzes need to have the following characteristics:

a) be legible
b) have a cover page
c) sent via elec
d) might be scanned in Microsoft Word

# Intro to Engineering Economics

What is Engineering Economics?

- Base for Engineering Economy Decisions
- Time Value of Money / Cash Flows / Financial Accounting / Replacement Decisions
- Taxes / Capital Costs
- Public Sector Decision Making

Selected levelized costs of electricity and levelized avoided costs of electricity... double bar graph of some kind, measures costs divided by production (todo: include images)

Engineering economy is a collection of techniques simplifying comparisons of alternatives on an economic basis. it is NOT a method or process for determining what the alternatives are, engineering economics only begins *after the alternatives have been identified*.

Engineering economic analysis is able to answer financial questions of varying caliber.
While economics is the sole criterion for selecting best alternatives, real-world decisions usually include other factors in the decision-making process.

# Frequent Engineering Economics (E.E.) Questions

- Why do the project at all? Is there a need for the project? (necessity)
- Why do it now? Can it be delayed? Can we afford it now? (urgency/affordability)
- Why do it this way? Is this the best alternative? Is there a better solution? (optimality/methodology)
- Will the project pay back? Will we run a loss or make a profit? (profitability)
