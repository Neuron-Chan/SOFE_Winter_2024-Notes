# Learning Objectives
- Convert uniform series of cash flows to their equivalent present or future values
- Use arithmetic and geometric gradients to solve correctly modelled problems
- Use continuously compounded interest with uniform payment series

# Uniform Series Compound Interest Formulas
- Uniform series (A) is defined as:
- An end-of-period cash receipt or disbursement in a uniform series, continuing for n periods
- The entire series equivalent to P or F at an interest rate i

![compound interest factors (slide 4)](../static/EE_5_1.png)

- In the general case:

F = A(1+i)<sup>n–1</sup> + . . . + A(1+i)<sup>2</sup> +A(1+i) + A                         **[1]**

- Multiplying by (1+i):

(1+i)F = A(1+i)<sup>n</sup> + . . . + A(1+i)<sup>3</sup> + A(1+i)<sup>2</sup> + A(1+i)    **[2]**

- Factoring out A and subtracting (1) from (2):

iF = A[(1+i)<sup>n</sup> – 1]

Rearranging the previous equation
𝐹 = 𝐴 [((1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> − 1) / 𝑖]

- The notation is F = A(F/A, i%, n)
- This is called the uniform series compound amount factor


Solving for A:
𝐴 = 𝐹 * [𝑖 / ((1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> − 1)]

- The notation is A = F(A/F, i%, n)
- This is called the uniform series sinking fund factor

Taking the sinking fund formula and substituting the single payment compound formula for F yields:
𝐴 = 𝐹 * [𝑖 / ((1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> − 1)] = 𝑃(1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> * [𝑖 / ((1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> − 1)]

- Therefore:
𝐴 = 𝑃[𝑖(1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> / ((1 + 𝑖)<sup>𝑛</sup> − 1)]

- Notation: A = P(A/P, i%, n)
- This is called the uniform series capital recovery factor

# The Role of Accounting
- Engineering economy focuses on the financial aspects of projects, whereas accounting focuses on the financial aspects of firms
- Three functions within businesses:
    1) Engineering economics: Analyzes economic impact of alternatives and projects over their life cycles
    2) Accounting: Determines the dollar impact of past decisions, reports on the economic viability of a unit or firm, and evaluates potential funding sources
    3) Management: Allocates available investment funds to projects, evaluates unit and firm performance, allocates resources, and selects and directs personnel
 
## Accounting for Business Transactions
- A business transaction involves two parties and the exchange of dollars (or the promise of dollars) for a product or service
  - Accounting functions:
    - Records, analyzes, and reports on transactions
    - Summarizes and analyzes financial data
    - Provides data for general accounting and cost accounting

# Primary Accounting Statements
- Balance sheet:
  - A firm’s financial condition at a specific time
  - Lists a firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity
- Income statement:
  - A firm’s performance over a period of time

## Balance Sheet

![balance sheet](../static/EE_3_1.png)

- Assets: Owned by the firm and have monetary value
- Liabilities: Dollar claims against the firm
  - Short-term (current): Due within one year
  - Long-term: Longer due dates (mortgages, bonds, loans, etc.)
- Equity (or net worth): represents funding from the firm and its owners (the shareholders)
  - At any point in time the difference between the total worth minus what is owed
- Fundamental accounting equation:
  - Assets = Liabilities + Equity
 
### Accounting

- For Engineered Industries
  - Total assets are $13,815,000
  - Total current and long-term liabilities are $2,180,000 and $1,200,000, respectively
  - Total equity is $10,435,000

- Fundamental accounting equation:
  - Assets = Liabilities + Equity
  - $13,815,000 = $3,380,000 + $10,435,000

- Working Capital
  - Working capital = Current assets – Current liabilities
  - For Engineered Industries, there would be $8,770,000 − $2,180,000 = $6,590,000 available in working capital

- Financial Ratios Derived from Balance Sheet Data
  - Firm’s health can be evaluated through ratios of quantities on the balance sheet
  - Current ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities
    - Shows the ability of a firm to cover current liabilities
    - Historically, firms have aimed to be at or above a ratio of 2.0
      - The current ratio is above 2 **(8,770,000/2,180,000 = 4.02)**

  - Acid-test ratio (or quick ratio) = Quick assets/Total current liabilities
    - With ~90 days
    - Shows the ability of a firm to pay debt quickly
    - Current inventories are excluded from quick assets due to the time required to sell them
    - Above 1
      - The acid-test ratio is well above 1 **[(1,940,000 + 950,000 + 4,100,000)/2,180,000 = 3.21]**

## Income statement

![income statement](../static/EE_3_2.png)

- Also known as the profit and loss statement
- Summarizes the firm’s revenues and expenses over a period of time (month, quarter, year, etc.)
- Used to evaluate revenue and expenses that occur in the interval between consecutive balance sheet statements
- The income statement reports the firm’s net income (profit) or loss by subtracting expenses from revenues
- Revenues − Expenses = Net profit (Loss)
- If revenues minus expenses is positive, there has been a profit; if it is negative, a loss has occurred

### Accounting

- For Engineered Industries
- Total revenues = $18,350,000
- Total expenses = $17,230,000
- **Net income = Revenues - Expenses**
  = $18,350,000 - $17,230,000
  = $1,120,000 before taxes
($730,000 after taxes)

- Financial Ratios Derived from Balance Sheet Data
- **Net Profit Ratio = Net profit/Net sales revenue**
  - Indicates cost efficiency of operations and firm’s ability to convert sales into profits
  - Net sales revenue equals sales minus returns and allowances
    - For Engineered Industries, the net profit ratio is **730,000/18,030,000 = 0.040 = 4.0%**
      
- **Interest Coverage Ratio = Total Income/Interest Payments**
  - Indicates how much revenue must drop to affect the firm’s ability to finance its debt
  - It should be at least 3.0 for industrial firms
  - Total income is total revenues minus all expenses except interest payments
    - Engineered Industries has an interest coverage ratio of **(18,350,000 − 17,110,000)/120,000 = 10.3**

- Linking the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Capital Transactions
  - There are many links between the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flows that make up business transactions
  - For engineering economic analysis, the following links are the most important:
    - Overall profit or loss (income statement) and the starting and ending equity (balance sheets)
    - Acquisition of capital assets
    - Depreciation of capital assets

- Linking the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Capital Transactions, cont’d
  - The overall profit or loss during the year (shown on the income statement) is reflected in the change in retained earnings (RE) between the balance sheets at the beginning and end of the year
  - To find the change in retained earnings (RE), one must also subtract any dividends distributed to the owners and add the value of any new capital stock sold
  - Change in Retained Earnings (RE):
    - **RE<sub>end</sub> = RE<sub>beg</sub> + Net Income(or Loss) + New Stock – Dividends**

![example](../static/EE_3_3.png)

- Cost accounting: Used to develop product costs, determine the mix of labour, materials, and other costs in a production setting, and to evaluate outsourcing and subcontracting possibilities

![traditional cost accounting](../static/EE_3_4.png)

- **Direct and Indirect Costs**
  - Costs incurred to produce a product or service are traditionally classified as either direct or indirect (overhead)
  - **Direct costs**: Activities directly associated with the final product or service produced (e.g., materials, labour, etc.)
  - **Indirect costs**: Costs not easily linked directly to individual products or services (e.g., machine depreciation, management/sales/administration costs, etc.)

## Indirect Cost Allocation
- Indirect costs are sometimes allocated across projects through “absorption costing”
- Allocating overhead costs based on factors (burden vehicle), such as:
1. number of direct-labour costs each project has
2. direct-labour hours
3. direct-material cost
4. total direct cost

## Other Problems to Watch For
- Centralized accounting systems have often been accused by project managers of being too slow or “untimely”
- If an organization establishes numerous files and systems so that stakeholders have the timely data they need, the level of accuracy in one or all systems may be low
  - Analysts making cost estimates will have to consider other internal data sources.
- Inventory or land valued too low because its based on acquisition cost
- Capital equipment being valued too high or too low depending on the depreciation methods and company policy

# Computing Cash Flows
- We describe the benefits and costs as receipts (cash flowing in) and disbursements (cash flowing out) at different points in time
- The foundation of engineering economic analysis are techniques for comparing the value of money at different dates

## Time Value of Money
- When monetary consequences of an alternative occur in a considerable period, we cannot simply add up the various sums of money
- Money
  - It has value over time
  - It is a valuable asset that people are willing to pay to have it available to use
  - It can be rented in roughly the same way that an apartment is rented
    - The charge is called interest instead of rent
    - Our preference for having money now rather than money in the future differs from person to person
      - The preference for having money now rather than later has nothing to do with inflation
    - The bank expresses the time value it puts on money by publishing its interest rate

### Simple Interest
- Interest that is computed only on the original sum and not on accrued interest
  - **Total interest earned = P × i × n = Pin**
    - Where: P = present sum, i = interest rate/period, and n = # of time periods (e.g. years)
  - **Total money after n periods (F) = P + Pin or F = P(1+in)**
    - Where: F = future sum
     
![simple interest ex](../static/EE_4.1.png)

### Compound Interest
- In practice, interest is determined using the compound interest method.
- Simple interest is normally not used unless specifically stated otherwise
- Interest is calculated on the accumulated amount and not simply on the original amount
  - Interest on top of interest

Below, consider a $25,000 loan at 10%/year

| Year "n" | Total in Year "n" | Interest accumulated at end of year "n" | Amount accumulated at end of year "n" |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | $25,000 | $2,500 | $27,500 |
| 2 | $27,500 | $2,750 | $30,250 |
| 3 | $30,250 | $3,025 | $33,275 |
| 4 | $33,275 | $3,327.50 | $36,602.50 |

## Repaying a Debt
- There are many ways in which debts are repaid, including the following three plans:
1. Constant principal
2. Interest only
3. Constant payments

# Equivalence
- Equivalence with respect to the “time value of money” implies that a sum of money in one time period may have the same “value” to a different sum in another time period with respect to an interest rate.
  - Example:
    - $1000 now is equivalent to:
      - $1100 one year from now at 10% per year
      - $1050 one year from now at 5% per year
      - $1210 two years from now at 10% per year
      - $1102 two years from now at 5% per year

- Equivalence is dependent on interest rate.
- Equivalence is useful when:
  - There are cash flows (positive and/or negative) over “n” time periods that need to be compared
  - There are alternative comparisons of multiple cash flows
    - Alternative projects with cash flows over “n” time periods


## Single-Payment Compound Interest

### Formulas
- Notation:
- i = interest rate per interest period
- n = number of interest periods
- P = a present sum of money
- F = a future sum of money at the end of the nth interest period, which is equivalent to P at the interest rate i

Assuming interest rate (n) is in years,

  After one year, the future amount at the end of year one would be
  **F = P(1 + i)**

  After two years, the future amount at the end of year two, including the additional interest from year one, would be
  **F = P(1 + i) + iP(1 + i)**

  Equivalent to:
  **F = P(1 + i)(1 + i)** or **P(1 + i)<sup>2</sup>**

  Generalizing:
  **F = P(1 + i)<sup>n</sup>**

### Simple and Compound Interest: Problem

How much more would you owe at the end of 4 years using:
- simple interest at 9% per year or
- compound interest at 9% per year

if you borrowed $150,000 now?

### Solution

_Simple Interest_

F = P + Pin = 150,000 + 150,000(0.09)(4)

F = $204,000

_Compound Interest_

F = P(1 + i)<sup>n</sup>

F = 150,000(1.09)<sup>4</sup>

F = $211,737.24

211,737.24 – 204,000 = $7737.24

You would owe **$7737.24** more with a compound interest arrangement.

# Nominal and Effective Interest
- When specifying an interest rate, we implicitly mention two time periods
- We pay an interest rate of i per time_period1, compounded every time_period2
- Effective interest rate: when these time periods are both the same
- Nominal interest rate: when the two time periods don’t match

## Interest Rate Statements
The terms ‘nominal’ and ‘effective’ enter into consideration when the interest period is less than one year.

**New time-based definitions to understand and remember:**

- Interest period (t) – period of time over which interest is expressed.
  - For example, 1% per month.
- Compounding period (CP) – Shortest time unit over which interest is charged or earned.
  - For example,10% per year compounded monthly.
- Compounding frequency (m) – Number of times compounding occurs within the interest period t

## Understanding Interest Rate Terminology
- A nominal interest rate (r) is obtained by multiplying an interest rate that is expressed over a short time period by the number of compounding periods in a longer time period: That is:
  - r = interest rate per period x number of compounding periods
    - Example: If i = 1% per month, nominal rate per year is
    - r = (1)(12) = 12% per year)
      
- Effective interest rates (i) take compounding into account (effective rates can be obtained from nominal rates via a formula to be discussed later).

IMPORTANT: **Nominal interest rates** are essentially **simple interest rates**. Therefore, they **can never be used in interest formulas**. **Effective rates** must **always be used hereafter in all interest formulas**.

![More About Interest Rate Technology](../static/EE_4.6.png)

## Effective Annual Interest Rates

Nominal rates are converted into effective annual rates via the equation:
𝒊<sub>𝒂</sub> = (𝟏 + 𝒓/𝒎)<sup>𝒎</sup> − 𝟏

𝒊<sub>𝒂</sub> = (𝟏 + 𝒊)<sup>𝒎</sup> − 𝟏

where 
- i<sub>a</sub> = effective annual interest rate
- i = effective rate for one compounding period
- m = number of times that interest is compounded per year
  - Example: For a nominal interest rate of 12% per year, determine the nominal and effective rates per year for (a) quarterly, and (b) monthly compounding
  - Solution:

(a)

Nominal r / year = 12% per year

Nominal r / quarter = 12/4 = 3.0% per quarter

Effective i / year = (1 + 0.03)<sup>4</sup> − 1 = 12.55% per year



    
(b) 

Nominal r /month = 12/12 = 1.0% per month

Effective i / year = (1 + 0.01)<sup>12</sup> − 1 = 12.68% per year


# Continuous Compounding
- The number of compounding periods depends on the number of subdivisions.
- A nominal interest rate of 12%/year compounded:
  - m = 1: yearly (equals 12% effective yearly)
  - m = 2: semi-annually (equals 12.360% effective yearly)
  - m = 4: quarterly (equals 12.551% effective yearly)
  - m = 52: weekly (equals 12.734% effective yearly)
  - m = 365: daily (equals 12.747% effective yearly)
  - m = 525600: hourly (equals 12.749% effective yearly)
- Note: we are approaching a limit!
- For infinite compounding periods (continuously compounded):
  - 𝑖<sub>-𝑎</sub>=(𝑒<sup>𝑟</sup>) − 1
  
- To find compound amount and present worth for continuous compounding and a single payment, we write:
- Compound amount F = P(ern) = P[F/P, r, n]
- Present worth P = F(e−rn) = F[P/F, r, n]
- Square brackets around the factors denote continuous compounding.

## Equivalence and Sustainability
- The formulas and methods we use give reasonable results when applied to time spans of less than a century, but can be misleading when applied to longer time periods
- Many of the problems humanity currently faces require us to plan on a time scale of centuries or longer
