Office hours: Mon

Missed midterms are deferred to Final exam.

Final is comprehensive

Project stuff:

- Project will look at estimating economics connected to different possible industrial applications. Five people. Deliverables are a written report and recorded video presentation.
  - Multiple Hybrid electric energy systems
  - These are some of the alternatives that will be proposed. However the group in the proposal can put something it retains interesting forward.
 
3 PARTS
A) Initial Investigation Feb. 19 2024
B) COST Estimation Mar. 22 2024
C) Final Report w/ Presentation Apr. 1 2024

Energy project will primarily look at estimating the economics connected to different electrical power plants alternatives (example:)
a) Nuclear SMR Reactor (Nuscale)
b) a PV solar power plant
c) a Wind Farm w/ Battery Storage
d) a Turbogas
e) Geothermal P.P

Each group will be composed by 5 people each of whom responsible for 1 part. [S.A.M. Software will be used](https://sam.nrel.gov/)

<ins>Costs will have to include:</ins>

a) Installation

b) operations & maintenance

c) Fuel

d) Personnel

e) Land

f) Final disposal

Each group will be expected to conduct proper literature review. A proposal of Hybrid A vs Hybrid B is expected (later on *compared for Economics* Considerations). A final Presentation w/ pre-recorded video will be uploaded as part of the deliverables.

# A Sea of Problems

Problems can be classified by levels of difficulty
- Simple (do not require much time or effort)
- Intermediate (primarily economic)
- Complex (mix of economic, political, and social/ethical)

# The Role of Engineering Economic Analysis

Engineering economic analysis is most suitable for intermediate problems and the economic aspects of complex problems. Such problems have the following characteristics:

1. The problem is *important* enough to justify serious thought and effort.
2. The problem can't be worked out in one's head-that is, a careful analysis *requires that we organize* the problem and all the various consequences.
3. The problem has economic aspects that are important in reaching a decision.

# The Decision-Making Process

![decision making](../static/EE_1_1.png)

1) Recognize the Problem - Once we are aware of the problem, we solve it as best we can
2) Define the goal or objective - The goal can be a grand, overall goal of a person or a firm, or it may be narrow and specific
3) Assemble Relevant Data - Obtaining information through market research or other data gathering is required. The time horizon of the problem (i.e. how long would it take to solve) must be assembled. A firmâ€™s own accounting system is recognized as valuable data. Must also include financial consequences (costs and benefits):

- Market consequences
- Extra-market consequences
- Intangible consequences
