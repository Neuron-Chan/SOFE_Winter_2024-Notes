# A Sea of Problems

Problems can be classified by levels of difficulty
- Simple (do not require much time or effort)
- Intermediate (primarily economic)
- Complex (mix of economic, political, and social/ethical)

# The Role of Engineering Economic Analysis

Engineering economic analysis is most suitable for intermediate problems and the economic aspects of complex problems. Such problems have the following characteristics:

1. The problem is *important* enough to justify serious thought and effort.
2. The problem can't be worked out in one's head-that is, a careful analysis *requires that we organize* the problem and all the various consequences.
3. The problem has economic aspects that are important in reaching a decision.

# The Decision-Making Process

![decision making](../static/EE_1_1.png)

## 1) Recognize the Problem - Once we are aware of the problem, we solve it as best we can

## 2) Define the goal or objective - The goal can be a grand, overall goal of a person or a firm, or it may be narrow and specific

## 3) Assemble Relevant Data - Obtaining information through market research or other data gathering is required. The time horizon of the problem (i.e. how long would it take to solve) must be assembled. A firm’s own accounting system is recognized as valuable data. Must also include financial consequences (costs and benefits):

- Market consequences
- Extra-market consequences
- Intangible consequences

## 4) Identify Feasible Alternatives
- Unless the best alternative is considered, the result will *always* be less than ideal
- Two types of alternatives are sometimes ignored:
  - Do-nothing” alternative
  - Unglamorous alternatives
- Ensure that all alternatives have been listed
- Impractical alternatives may lead to a better possibility

## 5) Select the Criteria for Determining the Best Alternative
- Define what we mean by “best” (i.e. term is variable and STC depending on problem)
- There must be at least one criterion, or a set of criteria, to evaluate which alternative is best
  - Ex. Maximum profit, minimize unemployment, create minimal disturbance to the environment, etc.

## 6) Construct a Model

The objective, relative data, feasible alternatives, and selection standards of the problem must be merged. In economic decision-making, this model is usually **mathematical.**

## 7) Predict the Outcomes for Each Alternative

To choose the best alternative, the outcomes for each alternative must be stated in a *comparable* way. 

The consequences of each alternative are usually evaluated in monetary terms, categorized by:

- Market consequences-where established market prices are available
- Extra-market consequences-no direct market prices, so priced indirectly
- Intangible consequences-valued by judgment, not monetary prices

In the short-term, costs and benefits can be considered to occur at the same time. A cash flow diagram is used to represent the timing of various costs and benefits. For longer-term problems, a common mistake is to assume that the current situation will be unchanged if the do-nothing alternative is chosen. *For example*, current profits may shrink or vanish as a result of the actions of competitors and the expectations of customers

## 8) Choose the Best Alternative

The right choice is the one that best meets the criteria after we have considered both the numerical and intangible consequences. Since intangible consequences are left out of the numerical calculations, they should be introduced into the decision-making at this point.

## 9) Audit the Results

An audit of the results is a comparison of what happened against the predictions.

Audits help *keep a project on track*, help *future estimates and assumptions*, and *provide an incentive* to give accurate estimates

# Ethics

Ethics can be described as **distinguishing right and wrong when making decisions**
- Establishing beliefs and moral obligations
- Defining values and fairness
- Determining duties and guidelines for conduct

Ethical decision-making requires:
- an understanding of the “context” of the problem,
- the possible choices, and
- the outcomes of each choice

## Ethical Dimensions in Decision-Making

In Canada, provincial and territorial associations of professional engineers are responsible for the regulation of the practice of engineering (Engineers Canada). For all engineers, difficulties arise when their actions are contrary to these written or internal codes.

## The Environment We Live In
The decision maker must ask who incurs the costs for the project and who receives the benefits. Ethical issues can be particularly difficult because there are often stakeholders with opposing viewpoints, and some of the data may be uncertain and hard to quantify.

(E.g., protecting the habitat of an endangered species versus flood-control projects that protect people, animals, and structures)

## Safety & Cost
Some of the most common and most difficult ethical dilemmas involve trade-offs between safety and cost. If a product is "too safe," it will be too expensive and it will not be used. And sometimes the cost is borne by one party and the risk by another. A balance must be struck between safety and cost.

## Emerging Issues and "Solutions"

Governments have prevented, limited, and exposed financial wrongdoing within corporations as a result of the latter breaching laws.

Globalization is an area of increasing importance within ethical considerations

## Importance of Ethics In Engineering and Engineering Economy

Mistakes can still be made even while acting ethically. The engineers' duty to speak out, within, and beyond their company is neccessary to protect the public.

# Engineering Decision Making for Current Costs
- If a decision is one where the results are known in a short period of time, it can be determined by:
  - Adding up costs and benefits between alternatives
  - Thereby, one can determine the best alternative

Example: (Tile for Plant Floor—fixed output)
- 1000 m<sup>2</sup>
- Tile A costs:
  - Purchase: $52/m<sup>2</sup>; Installation: $37,000
- Tile B costs:
  - Purchase: $63/m<sup>2</sup>; Installation: $28,000

Select Tile A to minimize cost for fixed output

![costs](../static/EE_1_2.png)

# Engineering Costs

## Fixed, Variable, Marginal, and Average Costs
- **Fixed**: Constant, unchanging costs
- **Variable**: Depends on the level of output or activity
- **Marginal**: Variable cost for one more unit
- **Average**: Total cost divided by the number of units
- **Break-even point**: The level of activity at which the total cost of providing the product, good, or service is equal to the revenue generated
- **Profit region**: Values of the variable x greater than the break-even point, where total revenue is greater than total costs
- **Loss region**: Values of the variable x less than the break-even point, where total cost is greater than total revenue

![costs](../static/EE_1_3.png)

### Problem
- A company operates a summer camp. The following cost data for a 12-week summer camp is as follows:
  - Charge per camper =$400/week
  - Variable cost per camper = $220/week
  - Fixed costs = $240,000 per summer season
  - Capacity per week = 200 campers

Determine the following:
- The total number of campers to breakeven for the season
- The profit if the camp is operated at 90% capacity
- The additional profit that can be made if a discount of $100 per week is given for another 10 campers

**a)** To break-even,

Total costs = Total revenue

240,000 + 220 (12)x = 400 (12)x

x = 240,000/ {(400 – 220)(12)} = 111 campers

**b)** 90% capacity

Number of campers = 0.90 (200) = 180

Profit = 180 (400) 12 – {240,000 + 180(12)(220) = $188,800

**c)** Additional profit = 10(12)(400 – 100) – 10(12)(220) = $9,600

- **Sunk Costs**
  - Money already spent due to a past decision
  - Should be disregarded in engineering economic analysis
- **Opportunity Costs**
  - The costs associated with a resource being used for an alternate task
  - Sometimes referred to as "forgone opportunity costs"
  - "An opportunity cost is the benefit that is forgone by engaging a business resource in a chosen activity instead of engaging that same resource in a forgone activity."
- **Recurring and Non-Recurring Costs**
  - Recurring: A cost that reoccurs at regular intervals
  - Non-recurring : One-of-a-kind cost recurring at irregular intervals
- **Incremental Costs**
  - Incremental: Cost differences between alternatives
- **Cash Costs versus Book Costs**
  - Cash costs: require a cash transaction out of one person’s pocket into the pocket of someone else
  - Book costs are recorded but are not transactions
    - Do not represent cash flows, thus are not included in engineering economic analysis
- **Life-Cycle Costs**
  - Designing products, goods, and services with a full and explicit recognition of the associated costs over their life cycles
  - Two key concepts:
    - The later a design change is made, the higher the cost
    - Decisions made early in the life cycle tend to “lock in” costs that will be incurred later

![life-cycle costs](../static/EE_1_4.png)

# Cost Estimating

**Types of Estimates**

- Rough Estimates
  - Quick/easy, high-level estimates where accuracy varies widely (accuracy of −30% to +60%)
- Budget Estimates
  - Used for budgeting projects where the accuracy is better than a rough estimate due to the extra effort used to make a determination (accuracy of −15% to +20%)
- Detailed Estimates
  - Estimates made from detailed designs using quantitative models and vendor quotes. High level of accuracy (accuracy of −3% to +5%)

**Difficulties in Estimation**

- One-of-a-Kind Estimates
  - First-run projects and projects that have never been done before
- Time and Effort Available
  - Human resources and time available for making estimates
 
## Estimating Models

- Per-Unit Model
  - Uses a per-unit factor (e.g., cost per square ft)
- Segmenting Model
  - “Divide and conquer” approach
  - Individual and component estimates are added together
- Cost Indexes
  - Historical change in costs as a ration relationship

![equations](../static/EE_1_5.png)

- Power-Sizing Model
  - Used to “scale up” or “scale down” known costs

![equations](../static/EE_1_6.png)

Where x is the power-sizing component
- x = 1.0 shows a linear power sizing component
- x < 1.0 shows the “economies” of scale
  - i.e., the more you buy, the cheaper per unit
- x > 1.0 shows a “diseconomies” of scale

- Triangulation
  - Approaching the estimate using different sources of data or different quantitative models to confirm the value initially calculated
- Improvement and the Learning Curve
  - A percentage or rate at which output is increased due to repetition
  
𝑇<sub>𝑁</sub> = 𝑇<sub>𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙</sub> × 𝑁<sup>𝑏</sup>

- 𝑇<sub>𝑁</sub> = time required for Nth unit of production
- 𝑇<sub>𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙</sub> = time required for the first unit of production
- 𝑁 = number of completed units
- 𝑏 = learning curve exponent

![equations](../static/EE_1_7.png)

• The Learning Curve: Problem
• In a complex assembly operation, it is found the learning curve rate is
70%. The standard time of 3 minutes per assembly is reached after the
110th unit.
• Calculate the time required for the very first unit.
• Calculate the time required for the 200th unit.

![solution](../static/EE_1_8.png)

## Estimating Benefits

Economic analysis often requires considering the benefits as well as the costs.

- Many of the same methods used to calculate costs can be used to calculate benefits
- Benefits are typically in the future, which sometimes makes them more difficult to estimate

# Cash Flow Diagrams
- Drawing a Cash Flow Diagram
- The Cash Flow Diagram (CFD) shows when all cash flows occur
- Look at Figure 1-7 and the $100 positive cash flow at the end of Period 2
- In a CFD, the end of Period N is always the same time as the beginning of Period N+1

![cashflowdiagram](../static/EE_1_9_1.png)

![cashflowdiagram](../static/EE_1_9_2.png)

## Categories of Cash Flow
- First cost: Expense of building or of buying and installing
- Operations and maintenance (O&M): Annual expense, such as electricity, labor, and minor repairs
- Salvage value: Receipt at project termination for sale or transfer of the equipment (can be a salvage cost)
- Revenues: Annual receipts due to sale of products or services
- Overhaul: Major capital expenditure that occurs during the life of the asset

# Outline
- Differentiate between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
- Learn the main principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
- Understand the laws of supply and demand, price elasticity, utility theory
- Understand the role of Bank of Canada

# Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics
| **MICROECONOMIC QUESTIONS** | **MACROECONOMIC QUESTIONS** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Go to business school or take a job? | How many people are employed in the economy as a whole? |
| What determines the salary offered by Citibank to John Smith, a new Columbia MBA? | What determines the overall salary levels paid to workers in a given year? |
| What determines the cost to a university or college of offering a new course? | What determines the overall level of prices in the economy as a whole? |
| What government policies should be adopted to make it easier for low-income students to attend college? | What government policies should be adopted to promote full employment and growth in the economy as a whole? |
| What determines whether Citibank opens a new office in Shanghai? | What determines the overall trade in goods, services and financial assets between the U.S. and the rest of the world? |

- Microeconomics focuses on how decisions are made by individuals and firms and the consequences of those decisions.
  - Example: How much it would cost for a university or college to offer a new course ─ the cost of the instructor’s salary, the classroom facilities, the class materials, and so on. Having determined the cost, the school can then decide whether or not to offer the course by weighing the costs and benefits.
- Macroeconomics examines the aggregate behavior of the economy (i.e. how the actions of all the individuals and firms in the economy interact to produce a particular level of economic performance as a whole).
  - Example: Overall level of prices in the economy (how high or how low they are relative to prices last year) rather than the price of a particular good or service.

## Microeconomics – Main Concepts
- Scarcity and rivalry
- Supply, demand and equilibrium
- Price elasticity
- Incentives and behaviors
- Utility theory
- Production theory
- Law of diminishing returns
- Law of increasing returns to scale
- Economic shortage and surplus
- Principle of comparative advantage
- Production possibilities
- Profit

## Individual Choice: The Core of Economics
- A resource is anything that can be used to produce something else.
  - Ex.: Land, labor, physical capital, human capital
- Resources are scarce—the quantity available isn’t large enough to satisfy all productive uses.
  - Ex.: Petroleum, lumber, intelligence
- Individual choice is the decision by an individual about what to do, which necessarily involves a decision about what not to do.
- Principles behind the individual choices include the following:
  - Resources are scarce.
  - The real cost of something is what you must give up to get it.
  - “How much?” is a decision at the margin.
  - People usually take advantage of opportunities to make themselves better off.

# Supply, Demand and Equilibrium
- The law of demand states that quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded.
- The law of supply says that as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their profits by increasing the number of items for sale.
- Focuses on supply and demand as the driving forces behind the production, pricing, and consumption of goods and services.
- Consumers and producers of a good vary the price and quantity of the good traded between them until price hits an
- **equilibrium point**: total quantity of the goods demanded = total quantity of the goods supplied

![s&d](../static/EE_2_1_2.png)

![s&d](../static/EE_2_1_3.png)

## Price Elasticity of Demand
- An economic measure of the change in the quantity demanded or purchased of a product in relation to its price change.

Price Elasticity of Demand = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price

- Price Elasticity of Demand < 1  => inelastic
  - e.g. oil, cigarettes
- Price Elasticity of Demand > 1  => elastic
  -  e.g. restaurant meals

![price elasticity demand](../static/EE_2_2_1.png)

## Price Elasticity of Supply
- An economic measure of the responsiveness to the supply of a good or service after a change in its market price. The supply of a good will increase when its price rises and will decrease when its price decreases.

Price Elasticity of Demand = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price

- Price Elasticity of Supply < 1  => inelastic
- Price Elasticity of Supply > 1  => elastic

![price elasticity supply](../static/EE_2_2_2.png)

Incentives and Behaviors
• Focuses on situations that motivate individuals or firms to behave in a
certain way. Has two types:
• Positive incentives
• E.g., rewards and payments, social status, etc.
• Disincentives or negative incentive
• Fines and taxes
• Incentives could backfire.
• Paying people to donate blood.
• Fining people if they are late to pick up their children from day-care.
