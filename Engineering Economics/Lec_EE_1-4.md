Office hours: Mon

Missed midterms are deferred to Final exam.

Final is comprehensive

Project stuff:

- Project will look at estimating economics connected to different possible industrial applications. Five people. Deliverables are a written report and recorded video presentation.
  - Multiple Hybrid electric energy systems
  - These are some of the alternatives that will be proposed. However the group in the proposal can put something it retains interesting forward.
 
3 PARTS
A) Initial Investigation Feb. 19 2024
B) COST Estimation Mar. 22 2024
C) Final Report w/ Presentation Apr. 1 2024

Energy project will primarily look at estimating the economics connected to different electrical power plants alternatives (example:)
a) Nuclear SMR Reactor (Nuscale)
b) a PV solar power plant
c) a Wind Farm w/ Battery Storage
d) a Turbogas
e) Geothermal P.P

Each group will be composed by 5 people each of whom responsible for 1 part. [S.A.M. Software will be used](https://sam.nrel.gov/)

<ins>Costs will have to include:</ins>

# A Sea of Problems

Problems can be classified by levels of difficulty
- Simple (do not require much time or effort)
- Intermediate (primarily economic)
- Complex (mix of economic, political, and social/ethical)

# The Role of Engineering Economic Analysis

Engineering economic analysis is most suitable for intermediate problems and the economic aspects of complex problems. Such problems have the following characteristics:

1. The problem is *important* enough to justify serious thought and effort.
2. The problem can't be worked out in one's head-that is, a careful analysis *requires that we organize* the problem and all the various consequences.
3. The problem has economic aspects that are important in reaching a decision.

# The Decision-Making Process

![decision making](../static/EE_1_1.png)

1) Recognize the Problem - Once we are aware of the problem, we solve it as best we can

2) Define the goal or objective - The goal can be a grand, overall goal of a person or a firm, or it may be narrow and specific

3) Assemble Relevant Data - Obtaining information through market research or other data gathering is required. The time horizon of the problem (i.e. how long would it take to solve) must be assembled. A firm’s own accounting system is recognized as valuable data. Must also include financial consequences (costs and benefits):

- Market consequences
- Extra-market consequences
- Intangible consequences

4) Identify Feasible Alternatives
- Unless the best alternative is considered, the result will *always* be less than ideal
- Two types of alternatives are sometimes ignored:
  - Do-nothing” alternative
  - Unglamorous alternatives
- Ensure that all alternatives have been listed
- Impractical alternatives may lead to a better possibility

5) Select the Criteria for Determining the Best Alternative
- Define what we mean by “best” (i.e. term is variable and STC depending on problem)
- There must be at least one criterion, or a set of criteria, to evaluate which alternative is best
  - Ex. Maximum profit, minimize unemployment, create minimal disturbance to the environment, etc.

6) Construct a Model

The objective, relative data, feasible alternatives, and selection standards of the problem must be merged. In economic decision-making, this model is usually **mathematical.**

7) Predict the Outcomes for Each Alternative

To choose the best alternative, the outcomes for each alternative must be stated in a *comparable* way. 

The consequences of each alternative are usually evaluated in monetary terms, categorized by:

- Market consequences-where established market prices are available
- Extra-market consequences-no direct market prices, so priced indirectly
- Intangible consequences-valued by judgment, not monetary prices

In the short-term, costs and benefits can be considered to occur at the same time. A cash flow diagram is used to represent the timing of various costs and benefits. For longer-term problems, a common mistake is to assume that the current situation will be unchanged if the do-nothing alternative is chosen. *For example*, current profits may shrink or vanish as a result of the actions of competitors and the expectations of customers

8) Choose the Best Alternative

The right choice is the one that best meets the criteria after we have considered both the numerical and intangible consequences. Since intangible consequences are left out of the numerical calculations, they should be introduced into the decision-making at this point.

9) Audit the Results

An audit of the results is a comparison of what happened against the predictions.

Audits help *keep a project on track*, help *future estimates and assumptions*, and *provide an incentive* to give accurate estimates

# Ethics

Ethics can be described as **distinguishing right and wrong when making decisions**
- Establishing beliefs and moral obligations
- Defining values and fairness
- Determining duties and guidelines for conduct

Ethical decision-making requires:
- an understanding of the “context” of the problem,
- the possible choices, and
- the outcomes of each choice

## Ethical Dimensions in Decision-Making

In Canada, provincial and territorial associations of professional engineers are responsible for the regulation of the practice of engineering (Engineers Canada). For all engineers, difficulties arise when their actions are contrary to these written or internal codes.
