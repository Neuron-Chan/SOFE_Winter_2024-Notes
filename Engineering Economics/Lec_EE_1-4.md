# A Sea of Problems

Problems can be classified by levels of difficulty
- Simple (do not require much time or effort)
- Intermediate (primarily economic)
- Complex (mix of economic, political, and social/ethical)

# The Role of Engineering Economic Analysis

Engineering economic analysis is most suitable for intermediate problems and the economic aspects of complex problems. Such problems have the following characteristics:

1. The problem is *important* enough to justify serious thought and effort.
2. The problem can't be worked out in one's head-that is, a careful analysis *requires that we organize* the problem and all the various consequences.
3. The problem has economic aspects that are important in reaching a decision.

# The Decision-Making Process

![decision making](../static/EE_1_1.png)

## 1) Recognize the Problem - Once we are aware of the problem, we solve it as best we can

## 2) Define the goal or objective - The goal can be a grand, overall goal of a person or a firm, or it may be narrow and specific

## 3) Assemble Relevant Data - Obtaining information through market research or other data gathering is required. The time horizon of the problem (i.e. how long would it take to solve) must be assembled. A firm’s own accounting system is recognized as valuable data. Must also include financial consequences (costs and benefits):

- Market consequences
- Extra-market consequences
- Intangible consequences

## 4) Identify Feasible Alternatives
- Unless the best alternative is considered, the result will *always* be less than ideal
- Two types of alternatives are sometimes ignored:
  - Do-nothing” alternative
  - Unglamorous alternatives
- Ensure that all alternatives have been listed
- Impractical alternatives may lead to a better possibility

## 5) Select the Criteria for Determining the Best Alternative
- Define what we mean by “best” (i.e. term is variable and STC depending on problem)
- There must be at least one criterion, or a set of criteria, to evaluate which alternative is best
  - Ex. Maximum profit, minimize unemployment, create minimal disturbance to the environment, etc.

## 6) Construct a Model

The objective, relative data, feasible alternatives, and selection standards of the problem must be merged. In economic decision-making, this model is usually **mathematical.**

## 7) Predict the Outcomes for Each Alternative

To choose the best alternative, the outcomes for each alternative must be stated in a *comparable* way. 

The consequences of each alternative are usually evaluated in monetary terms, categorized by:

- Market consequences-where established market prices are available
- Extra-market consequences-no direct market prices, so priced indirectly
- Intangible consequences-valued by judgment, not monetary prices

In the short-term, costs and benefits can be considered to occur at the same time. A cash flow diagram is used to represent the timing of various costs and benefits. For longer-term problems, a common mistake is to assume that the current situation will be unchanged if the do-nothing alternative is chosen. *For example*, current profits may shrink or vanish as a result of the actions of competitors and the expectations of customers

## 8) Choose the Best Alternative

The right choice is the one that best meets the criteria after we have considered both the numerical and intangible consequences. Since intangible consequences are left out of the numerical calculations, they should be introduced into the decision-making at this point.

## 9) Audit the Results

An audit of the results is a comparison of what happened against the predictions.

Audits help *keep a project on track*, help *future estimates and assumptions*, and *provide an incentive* to give accurate estimates

# Ethics

Ethics can be described as **distinguishing right and wrong when making decisions**
- Establishing beliefs and moral obligations
- Defining values and fairness
- Determining duties and guidelines for conduct

Ethical decision-making requires:
- an understanding of the “context” of the problem,
- the possible choices, and
- the outcomes of each choice

## Ethical Dimensions in Decision-Making

In Canada, provincial and territorial associations of professional engineers are responsible for the regulation of the practice of engineering (Engineers Canada). For all engineers, difficulties arise when their actions are contrary to these written or internal codes.

## The Environment We Live In
The decision maker must ask who incurs the costs for the project and who receives the benefits. Ethical issues can be particularly difficult because there are often stakeholders with opposing viewpoints, and some of the data may be uncertain and hard to quantify.

(E.g., protecting the habitat of an endangered species versus flood-control projects that protect people, animals, and structures)

## Safety & Cost
Some of the most common and most difficult ethical dilemmas involve trade-offs between safety and cost. If a product is "too safe," it will be too expensive and it will not be used. And sometimes the cost is borne by one party and the risk by another. A balance must be struck between safety and cost.

## Emerging Issues and "Solutions"

Governments have prevented, limited, and exposed financial wrongdoing within corporations as a result of the latter breaching laws.

Globalization is an area of increasing importance within ethical considerations

## Importance of Ethics In Engineering and Engineering Economy

Mistakes can still be made even while acting ethically. The engineers' duty to speak out, within, and beyond their company is neccessary to protect the public.

# Engineering Decision Making for Current Costs
- If a decision is one where the results are known in a short period of time, it can be determined by:
  - Adding up costs and benefits between alternatives
  - Thereby, one can determine the best alternative

Example: (Tile for Plant Floor—fixed output)
- 1000 m<sup>2</sup>
- Tile A costs:
  - Purchase: $52/m<sup>2</sup>; Installation: $37,000
- Tile B costs:
  - Purchase: $63/m<sup>2</sup>; Installation: $28,000

Select Tile A to minimize cost for fixed output

![costs](../static/EE_1_2.png)

# Engineering Costs

## Fixed, Variable, Marginal, and Average Costs
- **Fixed**: Constant, unchanging costs
- **Variable**: Depends on the level of output or activity
- **Marginal**: Variable cost for one more unit
- **Average**: Total cost divided by the number of units
- **Break-even point**: The level of activity at which the total cost of providing the product, good, or service is equal to the revenue generated
- **Profit region**: Values of the variable x greater than the break-even point, where total revenue is greater than total costs
- **Loss region**: Values of the variable x less than the break-even point, where total cost is greater than total revenue

![costs](../static/EE_1_3.png)

### Problem
- A company operates a summer camp. The following cost data for a 12-week summer camp is as follows:
  - Charge per camper =$400/week
  - Variable cost per camper = $220/week
  - Fixed costs = $240,000 per summer season
  - Capacity per week = 200 campers

Determine the following:
- The total number of campers to breakeven for the season
- The profit if the camp is operated at 90% capacity
- The additional profit that can be made if a discount of $100 per week is given for another 10 campers

**a)** To break-even,

Total costs = Total revenue

240,000 + 220 (12)x = 400 (12)x

x = 240,000/ {(400 – 220)(12)} = 111 campers

**b)** 90% capacity

Number of campers = 0.90 (200) = 180

Profit = 180 (400) 12 – {240,000 + 180(12)(220) = $188,800

**c)** Additional profit = 10(12)(400 – 100) – 10(12)(220) = $9,600

- **Sunk Costs**
  - Money already spent due to a past decision
  - Should be disregarded in engineering economic analysis
- **Opportunity Costs**
  - The costs associated with a resource being used for an alternate task
  - Sometimes referred to as "forgone opportunity costs"
  - "An opportunity cost is the benefit that is forgone by engaging a business resource in a chosen activity instead of engaging that same resource in a forgone activity."
- **Recurring and Non-Recurring Costs**
  - Recurring: A cost that reoccurs at regular intervals
  - Non-recurring : One-of-a-kind cost recurring at irregular intervals
- **Incremental Costs**
  - Incremental: Cost differences between alternatives
- **Cash Costs versus Book Costs**
  - Cash costs: require a cash transaction out of one person’s pocket into the pocket of someone else
  - Book costs are recorded but are not transactions
    - Do not represent cash flows, thus are not included in engineering economic analysis
- **Life-Cycle Costs**
  - Designing products, goods, and services with a full and explicit recognition of the associated costs over their life cycles
  - Two key concepts:
    - The later a design change is made, the higher the cost
    - Decisions made early in the life cycle tend to “lock in” costs that will be incurred later

![life-cycle costs](../static/EE_1_4.png)

# Cost Estimating

**Types of Estimates**

- Rough Estimates
  - Quick/easy, high-level estimates where accuracy varies widely (accuracy of −30% to +60%)
- Budget Estimates
  - Used for budgeting projects where the accuracy is better than a rough estimate due to the extra effort used to make a determination (accuracy of −15% to +20%)
- Detailed Estimates
  - Estimates made from detailed designs using quantitative models and vendor quotes. High level of accuracy (accuracy of −3% to +5%)

**Difficulties in Estimation**

- One-of-a-Kind Estimates
  - First-run projects and projects that have never been done before
- Time and Effort Available
  - Human resources and time available for making estimates
 
## Estimating Models

- Per-Unit Model
  - Uses a per-unit factor (e.g., cost per square ft)
- Segmenting Model
  - “Divide and conquer” approach
  - Individual and component estimates are added together
- Cost Indexes
  - Historical change in costs as a ration relationship

![equations](../static/EE_1_5.png)

- Power-Sizing Model
  - Used to “scale up” or “scale down” known costs

![equations](../static/EE_1_6.png)

Where x is the power-sizing component
- x = 1.0 shows a linear power sizing component
- x < 1.0 shows the “economies” of scale
  - i.e., the more you buy, the cheaper per unit
- x > 1.0 shows a “diseconomies” of scale

- Triangulation
  - Approaching the estimate using different sources of data or different quantitative models to confirm the value initially calculated
- Improvement and the Learning Curve
  - A percentage or rate at which output is increased due to repetition
  
𝑇<sub>𝑁</sub> = 𝑇<sub>𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙</sub> × 𝑁<sup>𝑏</sup>

- 𝑇<sub>𝑁</sub> = time required for Nth unit of production
- 𝑇<sub>𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙</sub> = time required for the first unit of production
- 𝑁 = number of completed units
- 𝑏 = learning curve exponent

![equations](../static/EE_1_7.png)

• The Learning Curve: Problem
• In a complex assembly operation, it is found the learning curve rate is
70%. The standard time of 3 minutes per assembly is reached after the
110th unit.
• Calculate the time required for the very first unit.
• Calculate the time required for the 200th unit.

![solution](../static/EE_1_8.png)

## Estimating Benefits

Economic analysis often requires considering the benefits as well as the costs.

- Many of the same methods used to calculate costs can be used to calculate benefits
- Benefits are typically in the future, which sometimes makes them more difficult to estimate

# Cash Flow Diagrams
- Drawing a Cash Flow Diagram
- The Cash Flow Diagram (CFD) shows when all cash flows occur
- Look at Figure 1-7 and the $100 positive cash flow at the end of Period 2
- In a CFD, the end of Period N is always the same time as the beginning of Period N+1

![cashflowdiagram](../static/EE_1_9_1.png)

![cashflowdiagram](../static/EE_1_9_2.png)

## Categories of Cash Flow
- First cost: Expense of building or of buying and installing
- Operations and maintenance (O&M): Annual expense, such as electricity, labor, and minor repairs
- Salvage value: Receipt at project termination for sale or transfer of the equipment (can be a salvage cost)
- Revenues: Annual receipts due to sale of products or services
- Overhaul: Major capital expenditure that occurs during the life of the asset

# Outline
- Differentiate between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
- Learn the main principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
- Understand the laws of supply and demand, price elasticity, utility theory
- Understand the role of Bank of Canada

# Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics
| **MICROECONOMIC QUESTIONS** | **MACROECONOMIC QUESTIONS** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Go to business school or take a job? | How many people are employed in the economy as a whole? |
| What determines the salary offered by Citibank to John Smith, a new Columbia MBA? | What determines the overall salary levels paid to workers in a given year? |
| What determines the cost to a university or college of offering a new course? | What determines the overall level of prices in the economy as a whole? |
| What government policies should be adopted to make it easier for low-income students to attend college? | What government policies should be adopted to promote full employment and growth in the economy as a whole? |
| What determines whether Citibank opens a new office in Shanghai? | What determines the overall trade in goods, services and financial assets between the U.S. and the rest of the world? |

- Microeconomics focuses on how decisions are made by individuals and firms and the consequences of those decisions.
  - Example: How much it would cost for a university or college to offer a new course ─ the cost of the instructor’s salary, the classroom facilities, the class materials, and so on. Having determined the cost, the school can then decide whether or not to offer the course by weighing the costs and benefits.
- Macroeconomics examines the aggregate behavior of the economy (i.e. how the actions of all the individuals and firms in the economy interact to produce a particular level of economic performance as a whole).
  - Example: Overall level of prices in the economy (how high or how low they are relative to prices last year) rather than the price of a particular good or service.

# Microeconomics – Main Concepts
- Scarcity and rivalry
- Supply, demand and equilibrium
- Price elasticity
- Incentives and behaviors
- Utility theory
- Production theory
- Law of diminishing returns
- Law of increasing returns to scale
- Economic shortage and surplus
- Principle of comparative advantage
- Production possibilities
- Profit

## Individual Choice: The Core of Economics
- A resource is anything that can be used to produce something else.
  - Ex.: Land, labor, physical capital, human capital
- Resources are scarce—the quantity available isn’t large enough to satisfy all productive uses.
  - Ex.: Petroleum, lumber, intelligence
- Individual choice is the decision by an individual about what to do, which necessarily involves a decision about what not to do.
- Principles behind the individual choices include the following:
  - Resources are scarce.
  - The real cost of something is what you must give up to get it.
  - “How much?” is a decision at the margin.
  - People usually take advantage of opportunities to make themselves better off.

# Supply, Demand and Equilibrium
- The law of demand states that quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded.
- The law of supply says that as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their profits by increasing the number of items for sale.
- Focuses on supply and demand as the driving forces behind the production, pricing, and consumption of goods and services.
- Consumers and producers of a good vary the price and quantity of the good traded between them until price hits an
- **equilibrium point**: total quantity of the goods demanded = total quantity of the goods supplied

![s&d](../static/EE_2_1_1.png)

![s&d](../static/EE_2_1_2.png)

![s&d](../static/EE_2_1_3.png)

## Price Elasticity of Demand
- An economic measure of the change in the quantity demanded or purchased of a product in relation to its price change.

Price Elasticity of Demand = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price

- Price Elasticity of Demand < 1  => inelastic
  - e.g. oil, cigarettes
- Price Elasticity of Demand > 1  => elastic
  -  e.g. restaurant meals

![price elasticity demand](../static/EE_2_2_1.png)

## Price Elasticity of Supply
- An economic measure of the responsiveness to the supply of a good or service after a change in its market price. The supply of a good will increase when its price rises and will decrease when its price decreases.

Price Elasticity of Supply = % Change in Quantity Supply / % Change in Price

- Price Elasticity of Supply < 1  => inelastic
- Price Elasticity of Supply > 1  => elastic

![price elasticity supply](../static/EE_2_2_2.png)

# Incentives and Behaviors
- Focuses on situations that motivate individuals or firms to behave in a certain way. Has two types:
  - Positive incentives
    - E.g., rewards and payments, social status, etc.
  - Disincentives or negative incentive
    - Fines and taxes
  - Incentives could backfire.
    - Paying people to donate blood.
    - Fining people if they are late to pick up their children from day-care.

## Utility Theory
Consumers will choose to purchase goods that will maximize their “utility,” depending on how much money they have available to spend.
- Usefulness, worth, values, benefit, satisfaction or happiness.

![law of increasing/decreasing](../static/EE_2_3.png)

# Macroeconomics – Main Concepts
- Circular Flow of Income
- Gross Domestic Product
- Measuring growth
- Unemployment
- Prices and inflation
- Aggregate demand and supply
- Labor productivity
- Recessions and expansions
- Macroeconomic policies


![circular flow model](../static/EE_2_4.png)


## Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics
In macroeconomics, the behavior of the whole macroeconomy is, indeed, greater than the sum of individual actions and market outcomes.
- Example: **Paradox of thrift**: when families and businesses are worried about the possibility of economic hard times, they prepare by cutting their spending.
- This reduction in spending depresses the economy as consumers spend less and businesses react by laying off workers.
- As a result, families and businesses may end up worse off than if they hadn’t tried to act responsibly by cutting their spending.

Economic activity is measured using Gross Domestic Product (GDP). **Gross Domestic Product** is the market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a given period.

## Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy
- In a **self-regulating economy**, problems such as unemployment are **resolved without government intervention**, through the working of the **invisible hand**.
- According to **Keynesian economics**, economic slumps are caused by inadequate spending and they can be mitigated by government intervention.
- **Monetary policy** uses changes in the quantity of money to alter interest rates and affect overall spending.
- **Fiscal policy** uses changes in government spending and taxes to affect overall spending.

# The Business Cycle
- The **business cycle** is the short-run alternation between economic downturns and economic upturns.
- A **depression** is a very deep and prolonged downturn.
- **Recessions** are periods of economic downturns when output and employment are falling.
- **Expansions**, sometimes called recoveries, are periods of economic upturns when output and employment are rising.
- The point at which the economy turns from expansion to recession is a **business-cycle peak**.
- The point at which the economy turns from recession to expansion is a **business-cycle trough**.

![business cycle](../static/EE_2_5_1.png)

![recessions + expansions](../static/EE_2_5_2.png)

![canada unemployment rate](../static/EE_2_5_3.png)

![us unemployment rate](../static/EE_2_5_4.png)

## Taming the Business Cycle
- Policy efforts undertaken to reduce the severity of recessions are called **stabilization policy**.
- One type of stabilization policy is **monetary policy**: changes in the quantity of money or the interest rate.
- The second type of stabilization policy is **fiscal policy**: changes in tax policy or government spending, or both.

## Central Banks
- A central bank is a financial institution that is responsible for overseeing the monetary system and policy of a nation or group of nations, regulating its money supply, and setting interest rates.
- Central banks enact monetary policy, by easing or tightening the money supply and availability of credit, central banks seek to keep a nation's economy on an even keel.
- A central bank sets requirements for the banking industry, such as the amount of cash reserves banks must maintain vis-à-vis their deposits. A central bank can be a lender of last resort to troubled financial institutions and even governments.
- The critical feature of a central bank—distinguishing it from commercial banks—is its legal monopoly status, which gives it the privilege to issue banknotes and cash. Private commercial banks are only permitted to issue demand liabilities, such as checking deposits.

### The Bank of Canada:
Main areas of responsibility
- The Bank of Canada is the nation's central bank. Its principal role is "to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada"
- Monetary policy: The Bank influences the supply of money circulating in the economy, using its monetary policy framework to keep inflation low and stable.
- Financial system: The Bank promotes safe, sound and efficient financial systems, within Canada and internationally, and conducts transactions in financial markets in support of these objectives.
- Currency: The Bank designs, issues and distributes Canada’s bank notes.
- Funds management: The Bank is the "fiscal agent" for the Government of Canada, managing its public debt programs and foreign exchange reserves.
- Retail payments supervision: Under the Retail Payment Activities Act, the Bank will be responsible for supervising payment service providers.

# The Role of Accounting
- Engineering economy focuses on the financial aspects of projects, whereas accounting focuses on the financial aspects of firms
- Three functions within businesses:
    1) Engineering economics: Analyzes economic impact of alternatives and projects over their life cycles
    2) Accounting: Determines the dollar impact of past decisions, reports on the economic viability of a unit or firm, and evaluates potential funding sources
    3) Management: Allocates available investment funds to projects, evaluates unit and firm performance, allocates resources, and selects and directs personnel
 
## Accounting for Business Transactions
- A business transaction involves two parties and the exchange of dollars (or the promise of dollars) for a product or service
  - Accounting functions:
    - Records, analyzes, and reports on transactions
    - Summarizes and analyzes financial data
    - Provides data for general accounting and cost accounting

# Primary Accounting Statements
- Balance sheet:
  - A firm’s financial condition at a specific time
  - Lists a firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity
- Income statement:
  - A firm’s performance over a period of time

## Balance Sheet

![balance sheet](../static/EE_3_1.png)

- Assets: Owned by the firm and have monetary value
- Liabilities: Dollar claims against the firm
  - Short-term (current): Due within one year
  - Long-term: Longer due dates (mortgages, bonds, loans, etc.)
- Equity (or net worth): represents funding from the firm and its owners (the shareholders)
  - At any point in time the difference between the total worth minus what is owed
- Fundamental accounting equation:
  - Assets = Liabilities + Equity
 
### Accounting

- For Engineered Industries
  - Total assets are $13,815,000
  - Total current and long-term liabilities are $2,180,000 and $1,200,000, respectively
  - Total equity is $10,435,000

- Fundamental accounting equation:
  - Assets = Liabilities + Equity
  - $13,815,000 = $3,380,000 + $10,435,000

- Working Capital
  - Working capital = Current assets – Current liabilities
  - For Engineered Industries, there would be $8,770,000 − $2,180,000 = $6,590,000 available in working capital

- Financial Ratios Derived from Balance Sheet Data
  - Firm’s health can be evaluated through ratios of quantities on the balance sheet
  - Current ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities
    - Shows the ability of a firm to cover current liabilities
    - Historically, firms have aimed to be at or above a ratio of 2.0
      - The current ratio is above 2 **(8,770,000/2,180,000 = 4.02)**

  - Acid-test ratio (or quick ratio) = Quick assets/Total current liabilities
    - With ~90 days
    - Shows the ability of a firm to pay debt quickly
    - Current inventories are excluded from quick assets due to the time required to sell them
    - Above 1
      - The acid-test ratio is well above 1 **[(1,940,000 + 950,000 + 4,100,000)/2,180,000 = 3.21]**

## Income statement

![income statement](../static/EE_3_2.png)

- Also known as the profit and loss statement
- Summarizes the firm’s revenues and expenses over a period of time (month, quarter, year, etc.)
- Used to evaluate revenue and expenses that occur in the interval between consecutive balance sheet statements
- The income statement reports the firm’s net income (profit) or loss by subtracting expenses from revenues
- Revenues − Expenses = Net profit (Loss)
- If revenues minus expenses is positive, there has been a profit; if it is negative, a loss has occurred

### Accounting

- For Engineered Industries
- Total revenues = $18,350,000
- Total expenses = $17,230,000
- **Net income = Revenues - Expenses**
  = $18,350,000 - $17,230,000
  = $1,120,000 before taxes
($730,000 after taxes)

- Financial Ratios Derived from Balance Sheet Data
- **Net Profit Ratio = Net profit/Net sales revenue**
  - Indicates cost efficiency of operations and firm’s ability to convert sales into profits
  - Net sales revenue equals sales minus returns and allowances
    - For Engineered Industries, the net profit ratio is **730,000/18,030,000 = 0.040 = 4.0%**
      
- **Interest Coverage Ratio = Total Income/Interest Payments**
  - Indicates how much revenue must drop to affect the firm’s ability to finance its debt
  - It should be at least 3.0 for industrial firms
  - Total income is total revenues minus all expenses except interest payments
    - Engineered Industries has an interest coverage ratio of **(18,350,000 − 17,110,000)/120,000 = 10.3**

- Linking the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Capital Transactions
  - There are many links between the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flows that make up business transactions
  - For engineering economic analysis, the following links are the most important:
    - Overall profit or loss (income statement) and the starting and ending equity (balance sheets)
    - Acquisition of capital assets
    - Depreciation of capital assets

- Linking the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Capital Transactions, cont’d
  - The overall profit or loss during the year (shown on the income statement) is reflected in the change in retained earnings (RE) between the balance sheets at the beginning and end of the year
  - To find the change in retained earnings (RE), one must also subtract any dividends distributed to the owners and add the value of any new capital stock sold
  - Change in Retained Earnings (RE):
    - **RE<sub>end</sub> = RE<sub>beg</sub> + Net Income(or Loss) + New Stock – Dividends**

- Cost accounting: Used to develop product costs, determine the mix of labour, materials, and other costs in a production setting, and to evaluate outsourcing and subcontracting possibilities

![traditional cost accounting](../static/EE_3_4.png)

- **Direct and Indirect Costs**
  - Costs incurred to produce a product or service are traditionally classified as either direct or indirect (overhead)
  - **Direct costs**: Activities directly associated with the final product or service produced (e.g., materials, labour, etc.)
  - **Indirect costs**: Costs not easily linked directly to individual products or services (e.g., machine depreciation, management/sales/administration costs, etc.)

## Indirect Cost Allocation
- Indirect costs are sometimes allocated across projects through “absorption costing”
- Allocating overhead costs based on factors (burden vehicle), such as:
1. number of direct-labour costs each project has
2. direct-labour hours
3. direct-material cost
4. total direct cost

## Other Problems to Watch For
- Centralized accounting systems have often been accused by project managers of being too slow or “untimely”
- If an organization establishes numerous files and systems so that stakeholders have the timely data they need, the level of accuracy in one or all systems may be low
  - Analysts making cost estimates will have to consider other internal data sources.
- Inventory or land valued too low because its based on acquisition cost
- Capital equipment being valued too high or too low depending on the depreciation methods and company policy

# Computing Cash Flows
- We describe the benefits and costs as receipts (cash flowing in) and disbursements (cash flowing out) at different points in time
- The foundation of engineering economic analysis are techniques for comparing the value of money at different dates

## Time Value of Money
- When monetary consequences of an alternative occur in a considerable period, we cannot simply add up the various sums of money
- Money
  - It has value over time
  - It is a valuable asset that people are willing to pay to have it available to use
  - It can be rented in roughly the same way that an apartment is rented
    - The charge is called interest instead of rent
    - Our preference for having money now rather than money in the future differs from person to person
      - The preference for having money now rather than later has nothing to do with inflation
    - The bank expresses the time value it puts on money by publishing its interest rate

### Simple Interest
- Interest that is computed only on the original sum and not on accrued interest
  - **Total interest earned = P × i × n = Pin**
    - Where: P = present sum, i = interest rate/period, and n = # of time periods (e.g. years)
  - **Total money after n periods (F) = P + Pin or F = P(1+in)**
    - Where: F = future sum

### Compound Interest
- In practice, interest is determined using the compound interest method.
- Simple interest is normally not used unless specifically stated otherwise
- Interest is calculated on the accumulated amount and not simply on the original amount
  - Interest on top of interest

Below, consider a $25,000 loan at 10%/year

| Year "n" | Total in Year "n" | Interest accumulated at end of year "n" | Amount accumulated at end of year "n" |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | $25,000 | $2,500 | $27,500 |
| 2 | $27,500 | $2,750 | $30,250 |
| 3 | $30,250 | $3,025 | $33,275 |
| 4 | $33,275 | $3,327.50 | $36,602.50 |

## Repaying a Debt
- There are many ways in which debts are repaid, including the following three plans:
1. Constant principal
2. Interest only
3. Constant payments

# Equivalence
- Equivalence with respect to the “time value of money” implies that a sum of money in one time period may have the same “value” to a different sum in another time period with respect to an interest rate.
  - Example:
    - $1000 now is equivalent to:
      - $1100 one year from now at 10% per year
      - $1050 one year from now at 5% per year
      - $1210 two years from now at 10% per year
      - $1102 two years from now at 5% per year

- Equivalence is dependent on interest rate.
- Equivalence is useful when:
  - There are cash flows (positive and/or negative) over “n” time periods that need to be compared
  - There are alternative comparisons of multiple cash flows
    - Alternative projects with cash flows over “n” time periods


## Single-Payment Compound Interest

### Formulas
- Notation:
- i = interest rate per interest period
- n = number of interest periods
- P = a present sum of money
- F = a future sum of money at the end of the nth interest period, which is equivalent to P at the interest rate i

Assuming interest rate (n) is in years,

  After one year, the future amount at the end of year one would be
  **F = P(1 + i)**

  After two years, the future amount at the end of year two, including the additional interest from year one, would be
  **F = P(1 + i) + iP(1 + i)**

  Equivalent to:
  **F = P(1 + i)(1 + i)** or **P(1 + i)<sup>2</sup>**

  Generalizing:
  **F = P(1 + i)<sup>n</sup>**

### Simple and Compound Interest: Problem

How much more would you owe at the end of 4 years using:
- simple interest at 9% per year or
- compound interest at 9% per year

if you borrowed $150,000 now?

### Solution

_Simple Interest_

F = P + Pin = 150,000 + 150,000(0.09)(4)

F = $204,000

_Compound Interest_

F = P(1 + i)<sup>n</sup>

F = 150,000(1.09)<sup>4</sup>

F = $211,737.24

211,737.24 – 204,000 = $7737.24

You would owe **$7737.24** more with a compound interest arrangement.

# Nominal and Effective Interest
- When specifying an interest rate, we implicitly mention two time periods
- We pay an interest rate of i per time_period1, compounded every time_period2
- Effective interest rate: when these time periods are both the same
- Nominal interest rate: when the two time periods don’t match

## Interest Rate Statements
The terms ‘nominal’ and ‘effective’ enter into consideration when the interest period is less than one year.

**New time-based definitions to understand and remember:**

- Interest period (t) – period of time over which interest is expressed.
  - For example, 1% per month.
- Compounding period (CP) – Shortest time unit over which interest is charged or earned.
  - For example,10% per year compounded monthly.
- Compounding frequency (m) – Number of times compounding occurs within the interest period t

## Understanding Interest Rate Terminology
- A nominal interest rate (r) is obtained by multiplying an interest rate that is expressed over a short time period by the number of compounding periods in a longer time period: That is:
  - r = interest rate per period x number of compounding periods
    - Example: If i = 1% per month, nominal rate per year is
    - r = (1)(12) = 12% per year)
      
- Effective interest rates (i) take compounding into account (effective rates can be obtained from nominal rates via a formula to be discussed later).

IMPORTANT: **Nominal interest rates** are essentially **simple interest rates**. Therefore, they **can never be used in interest formulas**. **Effective rates** must **always be used hereafter in all interest formulas**.

## Effective Annual Interest Rates

Nominal rates are converted into effective annual rates via the equation:
𝒊<sub>𝒂</sub> = (𝟏 + 𝒓/𝒎)<sup>𝒎</sup> − 𝟏
𝒊<sub>𝒂</sub> = (𝟏 + 𝒊)<sup>𝒎</sup> − 𝟏

where 
- i<sub>a</sub> = effective annual interest rate
- i = effective rate for one compounding period
- m = number times interest is compounded per year
  - Example: For a nominal interest rate of 12% per year, determine the nominal and effective rates per year for (a) quarterly, and (b) monthly compounding
  - Solution:
    - (a) Nominal r / year = 12% per year
          Nominal r / quarter = 12/4 = 3.0% per quarter
          Effective i / year = (1 + 0.03)4 − 1 = 12.55% per year
    - (b) Nominal r /month = 12/12 = 1.0% per month
          Effective i / year = (1 + 0.01)12 − 1 = 12.68% per year

# Continuous Compounding
- The number of compounding periods depends on the number of subdivisions.
- A nominal interest rate of 12%/year compounded:
  - m = 1: yearly (equals 12% effective yearly)
  - m = 2: semi-annually (equals 12.360% effective yearly)
  - m = 4: quarterly (equals 12.551% effective yearly)
  - m = 52: weekly (equals 12.734% effective yearly)
  - m = 365: daily (equals 12.747% effective yearly)
  - m = 525600: hourly (equals 12.749% effective yearly)
- Note: we are approaching a limit!
- For infinite compounding periods (continuously compounded):
  - 𝑖_𝑎=(𝑒𝑟)−1
  
- To find compound amount and present worth for continuous compounding and a single payment, we write:
- Compound amount F = P(ern) = P[F/P, r, n]
- Present worth P = F(e−rn) = F[P/F, r, n]
- Square brackets around the factors denote continuous compounding.

## Equivalence and Sustainability
- The formulas and methods we use give reasonable results when applied to time spans of less than a century, but can be misleading when applied to longer time periods
- Many of the problems humanity currently faces require us to plan on a time scale of centuries or longer
