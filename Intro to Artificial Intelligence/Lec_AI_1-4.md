# What is AI?
AI operates in its own "universe", systems that attempt to replicate human intelligence at a limited scale and scope. It is an attempt to reach two goals:

1. To know how "natural intelligence" works.
2. To build an intelligent "agent" or "entity".

Of these goals, only the second goal has seen significant and visible progress.


# Why is project management important?

Large amounts of money are spent on Info & Comms. Technology (ICT).

- Projects often fail; Standish Group claim only a third of ICT projects are successful. 82% were late and 43% exceeded their budget.
- Poor project management is a major factor in these failures.

# What is a project?

The definition can vary, but its most important aspects are its *planning* and *size*.

To compare:

Jobs – repetition of very well-defined and well understood tasks with very little uncertainty
Exploration – e.g. finding a cure for cancer: the outcome is very uncertain

Projects lie in the middle between a job and exploration.

A task is more 'project-like' if it is:
- Non-routine
- Planned
- Aiming at a specific target
- Carried out for a customer
- Carried out by a temporary work group
- Involving several specialisms
- Made up of several different phases
- Constrained by time and resources
- Large and/or complex

## Exercise 1.1
Which of the following is a project, a routine, or an exploration:
<details>
  <summary>Producing an edition of a newspaper</summary>
routine
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Building the channel tunnel.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Getting Married</summary>
project</details>

<details>
  <summary>A research project into what makes a good human-computer interface.</summary>
exploration
</details>

<details>
  <summary>An investigation into the reason why a user has a problem with a computer system.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>A programming assignment for a second year computing student.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Writing an operating system for a new computer</summary>
exploration
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Installing a new version of a word processing application in an organization</summary>
routine
</details>

Invisibility, Complexity, Conformity (compliance w/ standards, rules, or laws), and Flexibility make software more problematic to build than other engineered artefacts.

Projects can be

- **In-house:** clients & employers are employed by same organization
- **Out-sourced:** clients & employers are employed by different organizations

"Project manager" could be:
- a ‘contract manager’ in the client organization
- a technical project manager in the supplier/services organization

### Activities covered by project management
Feasibility study
- Is project technically feasible and worthwhile from a business point of view?

Planning
- Only done if project is feasible

Execution
- Implement plan, but plan may be changed as we go along
