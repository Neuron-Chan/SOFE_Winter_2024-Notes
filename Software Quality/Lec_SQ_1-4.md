## Group Work

Some of the assessment will be done as  Group work; some will be done individually. For group work, every group member need to know the content so that you can answer the quiz.

You will be divided into groups of 5. You sign-up for your grop using CANVAS. 

As a group member, you will be expected to meet all of the following group requirements:

- contribute a significant amount to the analysis, design, implementation, and testing of your  assignment…
- meet frequently with your group at a scheduled time
- communicate with your group partners as needed by email, in person, by phone, or otherwise
- hold your group partners accountable for their work, and report to group members/ TA/instructor if they fail to do so.

EACH group submission should include a table that identifies who did/ contributed  what to the submitted work and an estimate of time spent.  Group members are expected to carry out equal amounts of work.  Each group member is expected to be familiar with all parts of each assignment.  The assignments are a major part of the class.  The Content of each assignment will be in the final exam.

**Quizzes:**
- Lockdown browser will be used in quizzes and must be done in class. 
- Expect a quiz every week.

**Midterm:**
None.

Author's note: This course is a mess.

  # Outline:
*What is software project management?* Is it really different from *ordinary* project management?

*How do you know when a project has been successful?* E.g., do the expectations of the customer/client match those of the developers?

# Why is project management important?

Large amounts of money are spent on Info & Comms. Technology (ICT).

- Projects often fail; Standish Group claim only a third of ICT projects are successful. 82% were late and 43% exceeded their budget.
- Poor project management is a major factor in these failures.

# What is a project?

The definition can vary, but its most important aspects are its *planning* and *size*.

To compare:

Jobs – repetition of very well-defined and well understood tasks with very little uncertainty
Exploration – e.g. finding a cure for cancer: the outcome is very uncertain

Projects lie in the middle between a job and exploration.

A task is more 'project-like' if it is:
- Non-routine
- Planned
- Aiming at a specific target
- Carried out for a customer
- Carried out by a temporary work group
- Involving several specialisms
- Made up of several different phases
- Constrained by time and resources
- Large and/or complex

## Exercise 1.1
Which of the following is a project, a routine, or an exploration:
<details>
  <summary>Producing an edition of a newspaper</summary>
routine
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Building the channel tunnel.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Getting Married</summary>
project</details>

<details>
  <summary>A research project into what makes a good human-computer interface.</summary>
exploration
</details>

<details>
  <summary>An investigation into the reason why a user has a problem with a computer system.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>A programming assignment for a second year computing student.</summary>
project
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Writing an operating system for a new computer</summary>
exploration
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Installing a new version of a word processing application in an organization</summary>
routine
</details>

Invisibility, Complexity, Conformity (compliance w/ standards, rules, or laws), and Flexibility make software more problematic to build than other engineered artefacts.

Projects can be

- **In-house:** clients & employers are employed by same organization
- **Out-sourced:** clients & employers are employed by different organizations

"Project manager" could be:
- a ‘contract manager’ in the client organization
- a technical project manager in the supplier/services organization

### Activities covered by project management
Feasibility study
- Is project technically feasible and worthwhile from a business point of view?

Planning
- Only done if project is feasible

Execution
- Implement plan, but plan may be changed as we go along
