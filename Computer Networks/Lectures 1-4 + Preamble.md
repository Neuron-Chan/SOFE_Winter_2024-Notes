  **Intro:**
  - Information gathering, processing, and distribution are the key technologies in these days
  - As the ability to gather, process, and distribute information grows, the demand for sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
  - The merging of computers and communications has had a profound influence on the way computer systems are organized;
    - From computer center to computer networks

  **Uses of Computer Networks:**

  Computer networks are collections of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology, e.g., the Internet
  
  They have many uses:
  - Business Applications
    - Resource sharing
    - Information sharing
    - VoIP: Voice over Internet Protocol
  - Home Applications
  - Mobile Users

These uses raise social issues.

### Business Applications

Companies  use networks and computers for resource sharing with the client-server model:
Other popular uses are communication, e.g., email, VoIP, and e-commerce

|Tag| Full name| Example|
|---|---|---|
| B2C | Business-to-consumer | Ordering books online |
| B2B | Business-to-business | Car manufacturer ordering tires from supplier |
| G2C | Government-to-consumer | Government distributing tax forms electronically |
| C2C | Consumer-to-consumer |Auctioning second-hand products online |
| P2P | Peer-to-peer | Music sharing |

### Home Applications
- Homes contain many networked devices, e.g., computers, TVs, connected to the Internet by cable, DSL, wireless, etc.
- Home users communicate, e.g., social networks, consume content, e.g., video, and transact, e.g., auctions
- Some application use the peer-to-peer model in which there are no fixed clients and servers:

### Mobile Users

- Tablets, laptops, and smart phones are popular devices; WiFi hotspots and 4G LTE cellular provide wireless connectivity.
- Mobile users communicate, e.g., voice and texts, consume content, e.g., video and Web, and use sensors, e.g., GPS.
- Wireless and mobile are related but different:

| Wireless  | Mobile | Typical applications|
|-|-|-|
|  No | No  | Desktop computers in offices|
|  No | Yes | A notebook computer used in a hotel room|
| Yes | No  | Networks in unwired buildings|
| Yes | Yes | Store inventory with a handheld computer|

## Social Issues
- Network neutrality – no network restrictions
  - Communications that are not differentiated by their content or source or who is providing the content
- Content ownership,
  - Pirated music and movies
- Anonymity and censorship
  - Web browsers store cookies (small files) on users’ computers to allow companies to track users’ activities
- Privacy, e.g., Web tracking and profiling
- Theft of information, e.g.,
  - Botnets: pool of compromised machines used to send spams
  - Phishing: messages masquerade as originating from a trustworthy party (e.g. your bank), to trick you into revealing sensitive information
